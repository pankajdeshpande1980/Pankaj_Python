'''Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number (n!) using both loop types. Example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 '''
# Define input variable ( int)
# Define output variable for calulating factorial 
# Define a Itrator variable and set it to  1
# Sart while loop with condition - iterator <= input number 
    # PErform calculatons in o/p variable i.e multiply catorial to iterator 
    # increment of iterator by +1
# After loops ends Print (Use f-string)
