1. Simple Calculator Functions
Description: Create a program with multiple functions for basic arithmetic operations.
	• Write separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
      and exponentiation
	• Each function should take two parameters and return the result
	• Create a main function that asks the user which operation they want to perform
	• Call the appropriate function based on user input
	• Handle division by zero with appropriate error messages
	• Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in one session
Learning focus: This assignment teaches you how to create and call functions,
pass parameters, return values, and organize code into reusable blocks. 
It also introduces the concept of function composition where one function calls
others.
